# Lesson 1: Output and Math Operators

## Output

As seen in the introduction, we wrote the following line of code:

```python
print("Hello world!")
```

The `print()` function tells Python that we are going to be writing something to the screen. The quotes tells `print()` that we are going to be
writing a string, a string being any sequence of characters. We can experiment with `print()` by substituting different strings inside of the quotes.
Try the following:

```python
print("Welcome to python!")
```

As you can see, the output has changed to what we put inside of the quotes inside of `print()`. We will be using `print()` to visualize what we learn in these
lessons. `print()` can do more than just write strings. We can also write numbers:

```python
print(5)
```

## Math

Now we are going to learn about doing simple math with python and see the results using `print()`. Try the following lines of code:

```python
print(2 + 2)
print(2 - 2)
print(5 * 2)
print(4 / 2)
```

As expected, the symbols `+`, `-`, `*` and `/` are for addition, subtraction, multiplication and division respectively.
