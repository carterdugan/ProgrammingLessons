# Introduction

Python is a programming language that is growing more and more popular every year. In these lessons, you will learn the basics of programming in Python
including but not limited to:

* Input/Output on the command line
* Conditional Statements
* Methods/Functions
* Loops

In addition to written lessons, there will also be small project assignments along with their solutions. While the solutions will be available at any time,
it is recommended that you try the projects on your own before looking at the solution.

## Tools

Try to use one of the following websites to write and run your Python code:

* <https://www.online-python.com/>
* <https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler/>
* <https://replit.com/languages/python3>

If none of the above links work, please ask your teacher for assistance as the sites may be blocked.

## First program

Type the following code into your online IDE and click "run" to see the result.
```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

If you don't get the output `Hello, world!`, please ask your teacher for help or refer to the `Getting Help` section below

## Getting Help

Python produces helpful error messages for many issues relating to your code. Make sure to read those error messages when they appear. Try googling those messages when you are unsure what they mean.

For getting help, be sure to google your question first. In the beginning stages, many questions you might have will have already been asked in the past.
The most common place that you will find questions and answers is [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/).
